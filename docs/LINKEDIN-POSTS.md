## Post 1/3 — Launch Announcement

Meet **AnyCalc** — the calculator you actually want to use.

Every financial decision starts with "let me quickly calculate..." and ends with 3 browser tabs, 2 ad-filled sites, and zero clarity. Nobody actually runs the numbers.

Just shipped and now live at anycalc.in

**What makes it different:**

**Plan Mode** — Most calculators ask "what will I get?" AnyCalc also answers "what do I need to invest to reach my goal?"

**Prepayment Simulator** — See exactly how one extra EMI payment changes your loan timeline and interest saved.

**Tax Slab Visualizer** — Watch your salary flow through tax brackets in real-time. No more guessing where your money goes.

**Shareable Calculations** — For the first time, your calculations are shareable. Send a link, not a screenshot.

**Realistic Defaults** — Opens with sensible Indian market values. No more entering 5% returns in a 12% inflation economy.

**Fast. Mobile compatible.** No ads. No signup walls.

19 calculators. One clean interface.

Try it: https://anycalc.in

## Post 2/3 — Hidden Gems

**AnyCalc** has features you'll discover and love.

**Notes Section** — Remember why you chose those inputs. "Planning for kid's education" or "Comparing with Bank X offer" — add context that matters.

**Favorites** — Pin your most-used calculators. EMI + SIP + Tax always one click away.

**Export Options:**
- PDF — Beautiful visual reports
- Excel — Raw data for your spreadsheets
- HTML — Share with anyone

**Tab Persistence** — Switch tabs, come back, your inputs are still there. No re-entering numbers.

**Google Sign-in** — Want to sync across devices or keep your calculations forever? One-click login. Completely optional.

Built for people who actually use calculators, not just visit them once.

## Post 3/3 — Complicated Calculations, Simplified

Some calculations are just... overwhelming. **AnyCalc** simplifies them:

**Real Estate Capital Gains**
Selling property? STCG vs LTCG, indexation, Budget 2024 dual regime (20% with indexation vs 12.5% without), Section 54/54EC/54F exemptions — all in one place. No CA visit needed for the basics.

**Loan Prepayment Simulator**
Not just "what's my EMI" — but "what if I pay one extra EMI every year?" See exactly how much interest you save and how many months you cut off. Trial before you commit.

**BMI with Age & Gender Adjustment**
Most BMI calculators treat everyone the same. This one adjusts ideal ranges based on your age and gender. Seniors (65+) have different optimal ranges. Women have different body composition. The calculator knows.

Every calculator has Plan Mode, Notes, and Export.
